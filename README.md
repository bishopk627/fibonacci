# fibonacci
Calculator to determine the value of a given iteration of the Fibonacci Sequence

When run, the calculator will ask how many iterations of the sequence you'd like to calculate. It will then
generate a text file for each iteration, containing the value of the iteration.

Run this in an empty folder for best results.

Why did I make this? It's just a fun little tool I like to make. It's usually the first thing I do on my own
once I get a feel for a language.
